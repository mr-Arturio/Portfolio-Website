Simple, responsive portfolio website using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Decided to build something simple until I'll create something wild and creativeðŸ™‚


### to do:
- make everything more compact
- fix/edit about me text
- fix images
- add progects with imgs and links
- change font style?
- add stack icons instead of text
- stack categories? Front end, Back end? or all in one
- add dark mode
- add AI? feature
- add random fact about me
